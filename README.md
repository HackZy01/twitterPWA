# Twitter/X/Nitter PWA app for Windows 10 Mobile 

Twitter app revival for Windows 10 Mobile using Nitter.net - based on WebView XAML control with custom user agent to make again it run on Windows 10 Mobile.

I had to change to Nitter after the official Twitter site stopped working on EdgeHTML for some reason.
